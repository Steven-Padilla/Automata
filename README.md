#What is this automata for
This automata takes a folder with files (activities made by students from the universidad Polit√©cnica de Chiapas), these files should be named with the followings rules:
 ***ID_lastname1_lastname2.C(number 1-3).A(number 1-9).pdf***
 1. First 6 symbols (id), are the id from the universidad politecnica de chiapas -id's from 2018 to 2022- plus divider ("_"," ")
 2. Now, we have last names (two), separated with the dividers : (" ","_")  *LAST NAMES HAVE TO BE UPPERCASE*
 *Last names need to have at least 3 letters*
 3. Next to the second last name, we got a divider (same as the previos step, or  ".")
 4. Now,"C" or "c" that repesents in wich section of the four-month period was made the file, followed by a number from 1 to 3
 5. A divirder ("_",".") and an "A" or "a", followed by a number from 1-9 that represents the number of the activity.
 6. At last, it has to end with the extention ".pdf"
